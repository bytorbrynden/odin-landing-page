# The Odin Project - Foundations Course
## Project: Landing Page
In an attempt to jump back into the world of web development, I decided to work my way through "[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)". I made a personal commitment to follow along with everything included in the course, including all of the simplest projects. The second project, part of the Foundations Course, is to replicate a landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS.

This is the repository where you'll find what I submitted for the course. Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns.

### Project Requirements
There are no hard set requirements for this project, only a reference image, which I've included below. *(Source [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/))*
